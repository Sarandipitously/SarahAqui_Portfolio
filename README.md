## Portfolio Projects

### Capstone Project: Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landings
- **Goal:** Use historical SpaceX launch data to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.  
- **Methodology:** Data collection (SpaceX API, web scraping Wikipedia), data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA with visualization + SQL), model development, and evaluation.  
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).  
- **Results:**  
  - All models achieved **83.33% test accuracy**.  
  - The **Decision Tree** model performed best in training, with **87.68% accuracy**.  
- **Key Outcome:** Machine learning models can effectively predict Falcon 9 landings, supporting cost-efficient space launches and reusable rocket technology.
